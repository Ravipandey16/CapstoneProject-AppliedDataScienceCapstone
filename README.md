# Capstone Data Science Project

This repository contains the final capstone project completed as part of a Coursera Data Science specialization. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, covering data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based analysis, interactive visualizations, dashboard development, and predictive modeling.

## 🔍 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze real-world data to extract meaningful insights, visualize patterns using multiple tools, and build a classification-based predictive model to support data-driven decision-making.

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Data Wrangling  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Visualization  
3. EDA using SQL Queries  
4. Interactive Map Visualization using Folium  
5. Interactive Dashboard Development using Plotly Dash  
6. Predictive Analysis using Classification Models  
7. Results Interpretation and Conclusion
